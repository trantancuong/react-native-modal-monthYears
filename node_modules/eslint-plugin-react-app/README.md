# eslint-plugin-react-app

A minimal set of easy to install ESLint rules for your project: just install a single NPM package, add it to your `.eslintrc`, and you'll be all set.  

> This plugin exposes [the ESLint configuration used by Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app) without the need of declaring all its dependencies.  
Use it if you need a simple and tested ESLint configuration but you don't want to install a bunch of dependencies.  
It also works in React Native out of the box.

## Setup

1. Install it using npm: `npm install --development eslint eslint-plugin-react-app`.
2. Extend `plugin:react-app/recommended` in your `.eslintrc`.

Example `.eslintrc`:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:react-app/recommended"]
}
```

3. You're done!

## Configuring the rules (optional)

If you want to change a rule of an included plugin (for example of `eslint-plugin-react`) you must prefix the rule with `react-app/` (for preventing namespace collisions).  
For example:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:react-app/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "react-app/react/react-in-jsx-scope": ["warn"]
  }
}
```

## Adding Prettier (optional)

This plugin works nicely with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).  
Install it with `npm install --development prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`.   
And setup your `.eslintrc` like so:  

```json
{
  "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"]
}

```
